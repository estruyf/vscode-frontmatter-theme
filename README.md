# Front Matter CMS Theme for Visual Studio Code

This Visual Studio Code theme is intended to be used for the screenshots of the [Front Matter CMS](https://frontmatter.codes) website.

You are welcome to use it for your own projects. It is based on the [GitHub Light theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) with some color modifications to match the Front Matter CMS branding.
